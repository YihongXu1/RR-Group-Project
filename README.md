# ML methods in Covid-19 Classification

## Purpose

This repo is to reproduce the main findings of a published paper [Classification of Covid-19 Dataset with Some Machine Learning Methods](https://dergipark.org.tr/en/pub/jauist/issue/55760/748667). Data [COVID-19 Mexico Patient Health Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/riteshahlawat/covid19-mexico-patient-health-dataset/data) is downloaded from Kaggle. We aim to do a binary classification problem, where 1 indicates the patient is alive while 0 indicates the patient die.
